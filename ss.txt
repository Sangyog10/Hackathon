we want to create a app where i am creating backend using node. In this app, we are creating a marketplace where a local body/concerned authority
can post a job in the local area where the people of the realted location can go and work as per their interst due to which they will get reward
point according to the work and days they have worked. and the reward points  can be used to do various government work for free.
here admin and simple user can post job . if people do the work posted by admin they will get points but if they work for job provieded by user,
they wont get points. here admin can post job, and the way to verifiy if the people have attented the work is by alerting the system if the 
user get in the location of job posted. we want to track how much time the user in the job posted location.create an architecture so that it
will be easy for us to create the app.
